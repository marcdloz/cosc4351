Assignment# 4

Due Date: November 10, 2017 23:59:59

Description: XYZ is a website to which qualified individuals are encouraged to contribute information about the latest technology trends. Contributors may write original articles or comment on articles written by others.
XYZ wishes to encourage high-quality contributions by a wide range of contributors.  For this purpose, it plans to extend its current computer system to provide incentives that will reward participation.  The incentives are of four categories:
(a) Points for certain types of activity. 
(b) Badges given as recognition of specific accomplishments.  
(c) Rewards based on the quality and extent of contribution. 
(d) Bonus rewards derived from the other three categories.

Based on above requirements provide followings:


1. How will you measure quality of your software? (10)

- To measure quality for the XYZ website, we will need to assess the following criterea
to ensure that the software application is performing, with high quality, to the extent of the end goal:
Understanding the overall scope, Quailty Dimensions (Performance, features, reliability, conformance, 
durability, serviceability,asthetics, Perception), Montior quality control and assurance, Cost analysis of "known bugs" in program,
Project Management, Engineering practice, have relevant reviews (in terms of the metrics, "players" in the 
project, even review conductee from a higher source), Software testing before prodcution through strategy, and
lastly overall testing of the final production application. following these measuring criterea will ensure that the 
quality fo the web application will be high and successful.   




2. Provide project planning tasks document related to above requirements. Document must include: (60)

	- project scope
	- feasibility study
	- risk analysis
	- resource planning
	
	- Estimate cost and effort
	- Project schedule



3. Provide a plan for project maintenance. (10)
We will try implement the webapp in a way where its is as easy and efficient for the customer, hence the end user. 
The webapp will be self sufficient in sense that it will audit itself for all activity. All webapps should be designed in a modular way, 
so we will make sure to implement it as such. That self sufficiency that the webapp will implement will allow for software engineers to 
recognize what is going wrong and right for the end user as he or she uses it.
The cost of maintenance will be needed for any webapp, and must be defined in a way where it is feasible. 
There is a defined analysis that allows for the cost of maintenance to be calculated in a nut shell. 
Cmaint = [current annual business value of an application - (current annual maintenance cost for an application + current annual operation cost for an application)] x expected life of the system
Data architecture will be an important piece to do maintenance for a successful webapp. We will need to ensure that all data holds integrity, 
behaves properly and is functionally sound.
Lastly, Inventory analysis is key for any successful webapp. This again will relate to any such piece of code that is behaving improperly. 
Noting any such activities will allow for proper maintenance on the code and allow us to specifically pick qualified individuals to do so. 
This will be a continuous communication between the webapp and the software engineers.

4. Discuss how you can improve the process. (15)
When it comes to improvements, we defined impactful process that are essential to the success of the webapp to make improvements upon: 
1. Quality, 2. time analysis, 3. cost analysis, 4. personnel development. To successfully figure out and improve the processes, 
we will need to implement use cases to see which improvements we need to make.Process improvement will need to be constructed through the SPI Process. 
The SPI process will indicate what needs to be done as well as what actions we need to take to successfully improve the process. 
Already implemented tasks and actions will be then checked for consistency to make sure that proper functionality and cohesiveness 
is implemented in the webapp. We will need to carry out a level of sophistication and acceptance of the practice we intend to implement for the webapp. 
The software process and the engineering practice needs to be accepted and measured correctly to start the overall creation and design.
Commitment is key when it comes to having quality software. It is important that the service, being us, provide all employees proper training 
in terms of technicalities. Also having all material to build a successful webapp is very important, obviously, 
but emphasis should be made upon making sure that the newest technologies are available to utilize and make and impact.
Communication is key to any success. We will make sure that all useful implementations of communication will be available for any one on the project. 
This will ensure that everyone is available and interacting to produce a high quality product.
