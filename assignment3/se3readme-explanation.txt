In the attached PDF file, I have added both a sample site architecture design and a sample component-based design.

The included site architecture was built to describe on what we think what the site would be at it's current state. However, under the Profile page, the Rewards and Contributions would be the newly added pages for the assignment.
This is where the inclusion of the rewards, points and badge interfaces would be.

As for the component-based design, the overall structure would indeed be based off this structure which is of model-view-controller. We chose this design due to the the ease-of-use due
to it having more freedom on the elements and the reuseability of the components for easier software updating. A sample diagram has been provided to illustrate how the portion of the Benefits page would be designed which would
be the newly extended version of the website. The main hub (Benefits Session) would be required to have all interfaces of Rewards, Badges and Points components. With the Points component, it will need to have a connection
to Rewards as we are assuming you will have to exchange your points for the actual rewards listed. The Rewards component itself also would be required to the Benefits session as contributors may be awarded the rewards itself 
instead of having to use required points. Also, this would be where it connects to the Checkout interface to finalize the rewards then on to the Transaction component. To note, Points will only have an optional connection 
to the Checkout interface. This should work congruently with the sequence, user-case, activity and class diagrams that we previously created in Assignment 2.

Finally, we would use Angular 2 for our technology to create this due to it being a newly updated technology that utilized the MVC framework and is
component-based. If given the option to also create the database for data storage then mySQL would be a likely choice as well as Google Firebase. The project would be done under
the Agile methodology SCRUM due to the required code testing/refactoring which will be needed as well as how swift the business would want this extention to be done meaning fast
deliverables and multiple sprints. ATDD would als be utilized.
